+ abstract:
A high-accuracy Runge-Kutta/WENO method of up to fourth order with
respect to time and fifth order with respect to space is developed for the
numerical modeling of small-amplitude wave propagation in a steady
fluid-saturated elastic porous medium. A system of governing equations is
derived from a general thermodynamically consistent model of a
compressible fluid flow through a saturated elastic porous medium, which is
described by a hyperbolic system of conservation laws with allowance for
finite deformations of the medium. The results of numerical solution of one-
and two-dimensional wave fields demonstrate the efficiency of the method.
